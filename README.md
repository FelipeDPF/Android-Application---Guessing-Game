# Purpose:
This project had the purpose of implement, test, and deploy an Android Guessing Game.

# Explaning the game:
The user has 10 chances of guessing a number between 1 and 1000 in which each time will display a warning message informing if the number is too high or too low. 

#      - "Superior win!"  5 or fewer guesses
#      - "Excellent win!" 6 to 10 guesses
#      - "Reset":  More than 10 guesses

# Pressing the reset button will display the results with the number of guesses and more.

# More info:
More information about this project can be found inside the PDF file that contains all the steps required to complete this assignment.

# Files:
The zip file named HiLo contains the complete source code, but I also uploaded the three main java files inside the HiLo folder just in case you want to visualize the main implementations.

# Folder:
The image folder contains the front layout and display results image of the application.
